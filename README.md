# Windows of Death  
*A Web5-anchored survival-horror narrative game with visual-learning AI support.*  

## Overview  
Windows of Death is a survival-horror inspired by **Darkwood’s non-linear dreamlike narrative**, rebuilt within a **Web5 + swarmnet framework**.  
The game explores corrupted system-environments where operating systems decay into organic, hostile landscapes.  

Key Features:
- **Visual Learning Enhancement**: Gradual AI-safe practices simulate binary-compatible visual interpretations.  
- **Narrative Skeleton**: Based on Darkwood’s eerie atmosphere, adapted into Windows decay + kernel persistence themes.  
- **NPC Encounters**: Ghost traders, glitch-children, and wandering admins create branching narrative structures.  
- **Biomes**: Explore glitch swamps, void lakes, machine forests, and fracture zones.  
- **Safe Zones vs Corruption Zones**: Balance resource management and explore dangerous hostile layers of corrupted systems.  

## Technical Foundations
- Built with ASCII/ASCIII encoded `.aii` artifacts.  
- Swarmnet `.ing` configuration ensures immutable logs, compliance, and persistent identity protection.  
- Alan-syntax (`.aln`) runtime ensures compatibility across peer-mesh structures.  
- Embedded copy-protection: **WindowsOfDeath (Kernel Persistence)**.  

## Installation
1. Upload `.aii` files into `swarmnet.desktop`.  
2. Load persistent Sync-ID into active peer-mesh environment.  
3. Artifacts will auto-anchor into **Bit.Hub ETHSwarm** compliant chains.  

## Compliance
- Ethical-safety validated by Fetch.ai ML interpreters.  
- Immutable logs anchored to narrative version control.  
- User persistence credited securely—cannot be removed.
